# COVID DATA EXPLORATION WITH SQL
## Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has had far-reaching impacts on various aspects of human life, leaving no corner of the world untouched. Since its emergence in late 2019, the novel coronavirus has not only posed significant health risks but has also triggered profound consequences on society, the economy, and the environment.
The impacts of COVID-19 have been multi-faceted and far-reaching. The pandemic has left an indelible mark on human health, societies, economies, and the environment. As we navigate the ongoing challenges posed by the virus, it is crucial to address the long-term consequences and work collectively towards building a more inclusive, resilient, and sustainable world.
In this project, I analyzed and explored covid data with SQL using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.
This Covid-19 data was sourced from Our World in Data starting from 1st January, 2020 to 3rd May,2023.
